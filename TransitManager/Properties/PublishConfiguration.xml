	<LongDescription>
This mod automates ticket prices and number of vehicles in transit routes. This will make your transit system smarter and able to adapt to peak and off-peak hours.

## Settings

It is possible to configure how the mod will adjust transit routes for each mode (Bus, Tram, Subway and Train). The settings that can be changed include:

* **Ticket Price:** The user can configure the maximum fare increase and decrease for each transit mode. Fares will increase when vehicles are full to increase revenue and discourage more ridership, and they will decrease when vehicles are empty to encourage more riders.
* **Target Occupancy:** The mod will change number of vehicles and adjust fares to try to reach the target occupancy. However, because there is a limit on the number of vehicles per route and also on the fare increase and decrease, the target occupancy might not be met in some cases. Also, a high target occupancy might decrease the frequency of transit vehicles, which consequently might discourage transit ridership. So choose wisely.
* **Disable:** It is also possible to disable adjustments for each mode. In this case, the vehicle count and ticket price will remain with the previous values.
